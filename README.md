# Natural-Language-Processing-TF-IDF-

TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents. 
This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents.
It has many uses, most importantly in automated text analysis, and is very useful for scoring words in machine learning algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
